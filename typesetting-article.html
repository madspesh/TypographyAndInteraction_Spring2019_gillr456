			<p class="detail-description column-left">This semester's second creative brief was to design three typographic approaches for the desktop and mobile view of an article, using provided text and specific typefaces. The article was entitled ‘What New Year’s Resolutions Should Art Museums Be Making?’, and was originally published on the Walker Art Center website.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">The typefaces that we were permitted to use ranged from classic serifs Bodoni and Garamond, to modernist sans-serifs such as Futura and Gill Sans. We were asked to consider typography samples we had previously collected as inspiration for our designs, whilst limiting colour and sticking to a black and white colour palette only.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Process</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Defining page layout and text styles</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">I began by analysing the article and attempting to group similar content into paragraph styles such as headlines, subheadings and artist bios. Using these groups as a template to guide my structure, I then started sketching out some thumbnail wireframes of different layouts.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">We initially had to restrict all our designs to a black and white colour scheme, but we were later able to go back and introduce colour. No imagery was allowed to be used, so the page layout needed to be visually stimulating in order to keep the readers interest.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Solution</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">A visually engaging composition</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">Out of the three designs I created, the preferred layout was my single column design. I used a thick black stroke under headlines and subtitles to better separate the content, and I later changed this to bright yellow in order to make the titles even more eye-catching.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">The layout uses a single column, only breaking into two to introduce the date/author and the artist bio. I tried to make the reading flow more exciting by slightly offsetting some of the columns, and I used various different weights of the Akkurat and Memphis typeface families.</p>
