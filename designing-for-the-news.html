		<div class="detail-subtitle">Redesigning the Boston Herald</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">For our third studio project, we were asked to find three existing newspaper and/or news reporting websites located in a particular city (in my case Boston); two of which were in serious need of a redesign, and one which demonstrated a strong layout composition and user experience.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">Drawing from the good example, we were then asked to redesign the homepage structure of one of the lesser websites; first sketching out thumbnail wireframes, then creating potential style tiles, and then finally creating a mockup desktop view of the redesigned site.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="detail-title">The Process</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Low-fi sketches and style tiles</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">The three news websites I chose to focus on were the Boston Globe, Boston Metro and Boston Herald. The Boston Herald seemed out of the three to be the one with the most confusing user experience, so I decided to concentrate on making it easier to understand.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">I identified the main component categories (feature, most popular, headline, etc.) and sketched out alternative ways of presenting the information. The site needed to be responsive, so I made sure to adapt the new layout for desktop, iPad and smartphone.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Solution</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">A brand new homepage structure</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">After receiving feedback from my peers about which style tile was most visually appealing, I designed the new website interface using my thumbnail wireframes as a rough guide. Compared to the previous site, the redesign is much clearer with a clean minimalist UI.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">I tried to stick to the Boston Heraldâ€™s existing blue colour palette, but I decided to introduce orange as a secondary colour for buttons, links and other accents. A new blue navigation bar and bold statement numbering makes the site feel contemporary and striking. </p>
