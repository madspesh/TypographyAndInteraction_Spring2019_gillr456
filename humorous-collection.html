		<div class="detail-title">The Problem</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Creating within CMS constraints</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">For our penultimate creative brief, we were asked to curate an interactive collection (images, videos and gifs) that convey a humorous or a satirical concept. The task was to design within the constraints of a content management system (Cargo).</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">The content had to be an equal balance of self-created work and gathered content found online. Sources for found content could include range from Snapchat, Instagram and Vine to Youtube, Giphy and Imgur, among others.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="detail-title">The Process</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Experimenting with non-linear navigation</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">The topic that I decided to focus on was ‘doors’. I wanted to play with the preconception that a website’s navigation had to be linear and straightforward, and design a web experience that had no real beginning or end.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">Focusing on doors was a simple way to encourage users to continue clicking through the site, as a closed or partially open door is naturally a trigger for curiosity and exploration. My content was mostly composed of weird imagery, gifs and memes.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Solution</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Finding humour in ridiculousness</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">My final website was an endless series of linked pages, all leading to a different door background. Once the user had reached the last of my 20 pieces of content, they were directed back to the beginning and the process repeated itself.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">Although not hysterically funny, the absurdity of some of the content I created (such as Drake dancing in a barn) gave the website a humorous undertone. I took advantage of the variety of page animations that the Cargo CMS provided.</p>
