		<div class="detail-title">The Problem</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Collecting for desktop, tablet and mobile</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">The first project of our semester was to collect samples of typography on the web, collating screenshots of different type pairings across desktop, tablet and mobile devices. We were asked to arrange our findings into an InVision moodboard organised by device type.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">The typographic examples that we found needed to be embedded into the design layout and not from a standalone website such as Google Fonts. Our selections needed to be diverse and not always to our taste; it was more important to just have a good variety of different styles.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Process</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Identifying typefaces and weights</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">I used my laptop, iPad and smartphone to browse content, and I noticed that layouts designed specifically for tablet were actually quite rare. My examples included:<br><br><b>Serif Types</b><br><i>(Old Style, Modern, Transitional, Slab Serif, Monospace)</i><br><br><b>Sans-Serif Type Styles</b><br><i>(Geometric, Humanist, Grotesque, Square, Monospace)</i></p
			><p class="detail-description column-right"><b>Script or Decorative</b><br><i>(Novelty, Hand-drawn)</i><br><br><b>Weights</b><br><i>(Condensed, Light, Bold, Extra, Roman, Italic, Extended)</i><br><br>I referred to a number of sources for inspiration, ranging from agency websites, restaurant homepages and creative portfolios, to typography newsletters and design blogs.</p>

		<div class="detail-title">The Solution</div>
		<div class="detail-subtitle">Three curated InVision boards</div>
		<div class="column-full">
			<p class="detail-description column-left">After reviewing my findings and beginning to arrange my InVision boards, I realised that I have a strong preference for large serif headlined paired with smaller sans-serif descriptions. I tried to broaden my tastes by looking up products and brands that I wouldnâ€™t normally go for.</p
			><p class="detail-description column-right">My final collections are composed of a mixture of different fonts, weights and colours. The exercise was more difficult than I thought, and it forced me to get out of my comfort zone of bookmarked websites and blogs, and find new sources of inspiration.</p>
